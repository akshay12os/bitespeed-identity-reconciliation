Bitespeed Identity Reconciliation
Overview
This project implements the backend service for Bitespeed's identity reconciliation task. It consolidates customer contacts based on email and phone number, ensuring multiple contact entries linked to the same customer are unified under one primary identity.

Inspired by the FluxKart.com use case with Dr. Emmett Brownâ€™s diverse contact info, this service helps track customer identities across multiple orders.

Features
POST /identify endpoint to reconcile identities using email and/or phone number.

Creates new primary contacts when no existing match is found.

Links secondary contacts to a primary contact when shared email or phone number is detected.

Handles merging of contacts, updating link precedence as required.

Returns a consolidated JSON response including:

primaryContactId

emails (with primary contact email first)

phoneNumbers (with primary contact phone first)

secondaryContactIds array
